Customer segmentation involves dividing customers into groups based on their spending patterns and engagement. 
This project utilizes RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) Analysis to extract meaningful features and applies clustering techniques to segment customers effectively.

Key Features
1. Data Preprocessing:
-Handled missing values in columns like Description and Customer ID.
-Removed negative or zero values for Quantity and Price.
-Converted InvoiceDate to a datetime format for time-based analysis.
2. Feature Engineering:
-Created TotalPrice (Quantity * Price) to measure transaction value.
-Extracted Recency, Frequency, and Monetary (RFM) values per customer.
3. Data Normalization:
-Standardized RFM values using StandardScaler for optimal clustering.
-Optimal Cluster Selection:
-Used Elbow Method and Silhouette Score to determine the best number of clusters.
-Found 4 optimal clusters with a Silhouette Score of 0.61.
4. K-Means Clustering:
-Applied K-Means to assign customers into segments.
-Visualized clusters based on Recency vs. Monetary value.
